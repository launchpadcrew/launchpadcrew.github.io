							<p>Captain, We got a booster to go beyond the orbit ðŸš€ <strong>We create content that marries the needs of yours and your prospective fans</strong> - getting <span class="italic">tractions</span>(yours) and discovering <span class="italic">useful information & authentic story</span>(your fans). </p> 
								
							<p>
							<strong>What's our plan?</strong> We launch a kickstarter campaign for tutorial video series that help your product to get more traction. 
							This is known as a content marketing - we create useful information that customers seek out for themselves.  
							Our goal is to <strong>build shared experience</strong>  between you and your yet to be discovered fans.
							This helps to raise <span class="italic" >brand awareness</span> and acquire a new <span class="italic">distribution channel.</span>  
							</p>
